Hi. im making silly cat clicker for my friends.
i need this in github cuz github pages
How to play?
Click on repository website link.
No you don't need to download this.
It works only in website probably, idk not tested.
- 1.2.0 changelog
- removed multiplayer temporarily due to bugs
- removed saving clicks cuz no mp no saves
- added background.
- cat now looks better. "or worse"
  
next update will be worse cuz i will need to write code, and i don't know how to code.
basically i will fully rewrite it.
this is last update on this repository so i will archive it.
update will come with new repository
